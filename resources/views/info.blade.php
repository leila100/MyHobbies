                    But do you know how many kids HE has?

                    I was in a meeting recently where a big, new opportunity was being discussed and a very capable woman's name was put in the ring for consideration. And someone said "she is pretty busy, a big job and her 2 kids are young". After that a MAN in the room said, "we also just talked about this same opportunity for several men - and not once did we mention how many children they had."

                    I am just returning from maternity leave after having our 4th little girl. And this was a great reminder, that it's going to take both men and women in leadership to give women - not just equal pay, but equal opportunities. Regardless of how many kids, pets or plants we have depending on us.

                    For those young women wondering 'can I do both?' - you can. And it's wonderful.
